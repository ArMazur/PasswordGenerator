# Password Generator
Password Generator challenge from [hyperskill.org](http://hyperskill.org).

Main goal was to create password generator tool with certain rules:

+ It contains at least A uppercase letters, at least B lowercase letters, at least C digits and consists of exactly N symbols
+  Password cannot contain two or more of the same characters in a row
+ Output a password that matches these requirements
+ It is guaranteed that A, B, C, and N are non-negative integers, and A + B + C <= N
+ Any parameter can be equal to zero. It means that it's ok if the password doesn't contain symbols of such type.
